# Changelog

## 0.12.0 (2026-03-12)

### Changed

- **404 errors are now filtered by default** in Django and Flask integrations. Use `booboo.capture_exception()` in a custom 404 handler if you still want to track them.

## 0.11.0 (2026-03-11)

### Features

- **Django Channels support**: `ProtocolTypeRouter` is automatically patched when `channels` is installed — errors in both HTTP and WebSocket handlers are captured with full request context.
- **WebSocket error capture**: ASGI middleware now captures errors in WebSocket connections (previously only HTTP requests were handled).

## 0.10.0 (2026-03-03)

### Features

- **`capture_message()`**: Send plain message events (not tied to an exception) with `booboo.capture_message(message, level)`. Useful for tracking deployments, warnings, or custom events.
- **`ignore_errors`**: New `ignore_errors` parameter on `booboo.init()` to suppress known exception types from being reported. Uses `isinstance()` matching, so subclasses are automatically caught (e.g. `ignore_errors=[OSError]` also suppresses `ConnectionError`).

### Changed

- **`endpoint` parameter moved to end of argument list** in both `booboo.init()` and `BoobooClient.__init__()`. The default value (`https://api.booboo.dev/ingest/`) is now set directly on both functions. If you were passing `endpoint` as a positional argument, switch to the keyword form: `booboo.init("dsn", endpoint="...")`.

## 0.9.0 (2026-02-23)

### Features

- **Environment support**: `booboo.init()` now accepts an `environment` parameter (e.g. `"production"`, `"staging"`). The value is attached to every event and can be used to filter issues in the dashboard.

## 0.8.0 (2026-02-22)

### Fixed

- **SDK no longer crashes user applications** when thread creation fails (e.g., during interpreter shutdown). Replaced thread-per-event model with a single background worker thread + bounded queue — the same pattern used by Sentry's Python SDK.
- Fixed memory leak: completed thread objects were accumulated indefinitely in long-running processes.
- ASGI middleware no longer crashes on malformed request headers.

### Improved

- Event payloads exceeding 100KB are silently dropped instead of failing on the server.
- Local variable capture limited to 50 per frame to prevent oversized payloads.

## 0.7.0 (2026-02-20)

### Features

- Automatic exception capture via `sys.excepthook`
- Manual capture with `booboo.capture_exception()`
- User context with `booboo.set_user()`
- Rich stack traces with source context and local variables
- PII scrubbing for sensitive headers and local variables
- Exception chain support (`__cause__` and `__context__`)
- Framework integrations:
  - **Django**: automatic middleware injection + internal exception capture
  - **Flask**: error handler registration (explicit or monkey-patched)
  - **FastAPI**: ASGI middleware (explicit or monkey-patched)
- Non-blocking event delivery via background threads
- Graceful shutdown with `atexit` flush
